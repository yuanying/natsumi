/**
 * The dove's judge by the logprobs of an OpenAI-compatible model (ADR 0040): by default pi's own, which the owner runs.
 * Each question is one `chat/completions` request for a single token, with thinking off and the top logprobs asked
 * for. A Noul's score is the probability of "yes" over "yes" and "no" among the first token's candidates; the placement
 * is asked with lettered options, and its probabilities are those of the letters made to sum to one.
 *
 * The state and the questions are `judge.ts`'s, the same the Jev method sends, so the method changes how a draft is
 * judged and not what. The state comes first in every request and the question after it, so the questions about one
 * draft share their prefix and the model's cache.
 *
 * Any question without an answer — no logprobs, neither answer among the candidates, a thinking tag in its place, a
 * refusal — makes the whole judgement "no verdict", as a Jev answer missing a field does. So does the time limit,
 * which covers the judgement as a whole.
